title: Advanced Retrieval
---

Mem0's **Advanced Retrieval** feature delivers superior search results by leveraging state-of-the-art search algorithms. Beyond the default search functionality, Mem0 offers the following advanced retrieval modes:

1. **Keyword Search**

   This mode emphasizes keywords within the query, returning memories that contain the most relevant keywords alongside those from the default search. By default, this parameter is set to `false`. Enabling it enhances search recall, though it may slightly impact precision.

   ```python
   client.search(query, keyword_search=True, user_id='alex')
   ```

2. **Reranking**

   Reranking allows you to reorder the memories returned by the default search based on relevance. This parameter is set to `false` by default. When enabled, it reorders the memories based on the relevance score.

   ```python
   client.search(query, rerank=True, user_id='alex')
   ```

3. **Filtering**

   Filtering enables you to narrow down the search results by applying specific criteria. This parameter is set to `false` by default. Activating it enhances search precision, potentially reducing recall by a small margin.

   ```python
   client.search(query, filter_memories=True, user_id='alex')
   ```

**Note:** You can enable or disable these search modes by passing the respective parameters to the `search` method. There is no required sequence for these modes, and any combination can be used based on your needs.


### Latency Numbers

Here are the typical latency ranges for each search mode:

| **Mode**            | **Latency**      |
|---------------------|------------------|
| **Keyword Search**  | **>10ms**        |
| **Reranking**       | **150-200ms**    |
| **Filtering**       | **200-300ms**    |
